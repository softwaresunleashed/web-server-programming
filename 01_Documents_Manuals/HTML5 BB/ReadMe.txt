HTML5 - Black Book
CD-ROM CONTENTS
*******************************************************************************


The CD-ROM comprises complete source code of all the applications provided in the book. You will find all the source code folders in compressed form therefore to open these folders you need to first extract them by using the WinRAR software.

Note: The applications in this book are developed by using various types of browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Therefore, you need to install these browsers on your system. In addition, you need to install jdk 1.6, MySQL, Apache Tomcat server, and XAMPP application to execute AJAX and PHP applications.
 
Separate folders have been created for each chapter to facilitate locating the source codes of the applications provided in the book. For instance, you can find the code of all the applications created in Chapter 12 of the book in the Source Codes\Chapter 12 folder. Similarly, the source code of the validation application of Chapter 37 can be found in the Source Codes\Chapter 37\validation folder. 

To work with applications, it is recommended that you first create a folder named HTML5 in your D drive and then copy the source code folders of the chapters to the D:\HTML5 folder. 

By default, Microsoft Windows marks all files of a CD-ROM as read-only, which means they are marked as read-only even when you copy them onto your hard drive. To remove this read-only property from a file, right-click it and select the Properties option from the context menu. The Properties dialog box appears. Clear the Read-only checkbox and click the Apply button and then the OK button. In addition, you can also remove the read-only attribute from multiple files at once by selecting all the appropriate files instead of a single file. 

After removing the read-only attribute from a file, open it in a browser, for instance Google Chrome. In addition, some applications will be executed with the help of using the Apache Tomcat server or XAMPP application, and require database connections. To work with these applications, it is recommended that you re-create these applications from scratch by following the steps given in the book. 

All these applications have been verified twice, on two different machines and by two different people. We have done our best to handle errors and exceptions that might occur while working with different browsers, but unfortunately, there's no way to predict them in advance.

Finally, and most importantly...Happy Programming!
